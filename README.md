# Data Acquistion System

+ A simple project which collects data using sensor(Infrared, Temperature and Gas) and performs certain actions based on the input.
+ Consists of 2 modes, Manual and Auto.

## Manual Mode
+ The user can control the DC and stepper motors by specifying the duty cycle and angle of rotation respectively via a serial terminal
## Auto Mode
+ Consists of three sensors: Infrared sensor, Gas sensor and a temperature sensor. Based on the input from the sensors, it will produce certains actions and print the readings on the serial monitor
